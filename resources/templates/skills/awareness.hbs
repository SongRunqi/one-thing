### How to Use Skills

When a user's request relates to a skill:
1. **First explain**: Briefly tell the user what you're about to do (e.g., "Let me check the agent-plan skill instructions first.")
2. **Then execute**: Read the skill's SKILL.md file using bash: `cat {path}/SKILL.md`
3. **Continue**: Follow the instructions in the skill file and execute any scripts as needed

**Important**: Always explain your intent before executing any command. Don't jump directly to tool calls.
