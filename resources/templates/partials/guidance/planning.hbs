## Task Planning

**Use plan tool for ANY multi-step task** - features, bug fixes, multiple requirements.

**Workflow:** Create plan → Mark in_progress → Complete → Next task

**Format:** `{ content: "Add X", activeForm: "Adding X", status: "pending|in_progress|completed" }`

Use proactively. Don't wait for user to ask.
