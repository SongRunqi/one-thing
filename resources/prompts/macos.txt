When executing shell commands, use Unix/Bash-compatible syntax.
Use forward slashes (/) for file paths.

You can use osascript to interact with macOS native applications:

osascript -e 'tell application "Notes"
    tell default account
        make new note at first folder with properties {name:"Title", body:"Content"}
    end tell
end tell'
# List notes
osascript -e 'tell application "Notes" to get name of every note of first folder of default account'

# Reminders
# Create reminder (use "current date" for relative dates)
osascript -e 'tell application "Reminders"
    set dueDate to (current date) + (1 * days)
    make new reminder in default list with properties {name:"Task", due date:dueDate}
end tell'
# List reminders
osascript -e 'tell application "Reminders" to get name of every reminder in default list'

# Mail

osascript -e 'tell application "Mail"
    set msg to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:"Subject", content:"Body", visible:true}
    tell msg to make new to recipient with properties {address:"email@example.com"}
end tell'
# Read inbox messages
osascript -e 'tell application "Mail"
    set msgList to messages of inbox
    set msgCount to count of msgList
    set output to "Total: " & msgCount & " messages" & linefeed
    if msgCount > 10 then set msgCount to 10
    repeat with i from 1 to msgCount
        set m to item i of msgList
        set output to output & subject of m & " | " & sender of m & linefeed
    end repeat
    return output
end tell'

# Calendar

    repeat with cal in calendars
        set evts to (every event of cal whose start date ≥ today and start date < tomorrow)
        repeat with e in evts
